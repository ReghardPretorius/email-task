# Email Task by R Pretorius

Dear Joe,

I hope you are having a productive week. From our side, we are extremely excited to integrate with your fin-tech solution and hope to enable you guys to achieve success beyond your most umimaginable goals. I just want to use this email to sync up with you around the information we require from you, which will help us get a better picture of the type of integration which will be best suited for you current, as well as future needs.

The info which will have the biggest influence on how we integrate with your product will be around your transactional flows. More precisely:
-	The different financial transactional processes you have.
-	The volume and the speed at which these transactions are being processed.
-	How much the different financial transactional processes vary.

We are also aware of the fact that you are behind schedule, and over budget due to a few unforeseen circumstances. However, it is still important that we do diligent planning and layout clear requirements of what might be needed in the future to prevent any unforeseen costs in the long run.

Keeping all of that in mind we can determine the following:
1.	Whether we need to set up a real time endpoint (which will incur more cost and time now), or set up a nightly batch upload (less resource intensive, but will cause an additional burden if you want to move to a real time endpoint later in time).
2.	Whether we can use a single schema for all transactions (the data will more generic and require less time to develop but may become a problem as the data get bigger) or if multiple schemas are needed (data but it will be more specific and versatile but will also attract more cost).
3.	The amount of infrastructure needed to be provisioned for the integration (Under provisioning will cause serious delays and even downtime, while over provisioning could be a financial waste).

Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us if you require any more information or need clarifying of something. We look forward to hearing from you about your transaction flows and the route you decide to take. If needed, we will be more than happy to assist you in your journey to integration.

Kind regards,

Reghard Pretorius
